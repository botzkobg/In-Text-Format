# YI Cameras

## Custom Firmwares

The camera comes with the original cloud firmware. There are custom firmwares for the camera but they depend on the model, serial number and the original firmware version. Here is a list of tome of the projects:

* https://github.com/TheCrypt0/yi-hack-v4 
* https://github.com/roleoroleo/yi-hack-MStar
* https://github.com/roleoroleo/yi-hack-Allwinner
* https://github.com/roleoroleo/yi-hack-Allwinner-v2

Each of them support different models, serial numbers and firmware. The original project seems to be `yi-hack-v4`.

## YI 1080p Home 9FUS 8.2.0*

The `YI 1080p Home` camera with serial number starting with `9FUS` and firmware version `8.2.0*` can user the `yi-hack-Allwinner` firmware. Just follow the instructions on the project to flash the firmware. Be sure to use the `y20ga` prefix.
